"""
Pipeline Orchestrator — Stage 6
Now powered by LangGraph. The manual agent loop is replaced by the compiled
graph in core/graph.py. This file is a thin async adapter that:
  1. Builds the initial PipelineState
  2. Runs the graph
  3. Streams events back to the API layer as SSE-compatible dicts

The old pipeline.py is kept compatible — same interface, new internals.
